College is expensive and students have a limited amount of time to take the courses they need for their academic programs. Community college courses are relatively cheap but their are so many options and it can be tedious to find out which courses transfer to UMD for academic credit. This is a database and web application of community college courses from various schools, when theyâ€™re available, and what their UMD equivalences are.
