This is the search filter that you will use to find the classes you want. It has 3 filters:
* Class or Class ID
* Semester
* College

## Class or Class ID
![](/images/Course.png)
This is the Class or Class ID filter. It has no default value. The input type is text. If you know the Class ID of the class you want to take, like "INST 377" or "INST", then you can input that into the spot designated by the arrow and hit search. If not then you can input the type of class you want, like "Biology", and it will display all classes that are Biology related. This is the only required item as the other two have their default values set to "any".

## Semester
![](/images/semester.png)
This is the Semester filter. It's default value is "any" so it will give you results from all the semesters available. The input type is a drop down menu. All you have to do is select the desired semester from the drop down menu or any to search for all semesters.

## College
![](/images/college.png)
This is the College filter. It's default value is "any" so it will give results from all the colleges available. The input type is a drop down menu. All you have to do is select the desired college from the drop down menu or leave it as any to search for all colleges.

You can set specific values for all of these filters or almost any combination of the three. As long as you have the Class or Class ID input filled out appropriately.
