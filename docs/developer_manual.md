###  HTML/CSS

<<<<<<< HEAD
If you want to add more filters or change the options for the current filters.
You have to edit the "index.php" file in the root. We use Bootstrap CSS to style
the webpage. There is some CSS done in the file inside the "css" folder. However
we do use some of the div classes that is provided with Bootstrap in the
"index.php" file, that is mainly done in-line.

### Database

We use SQLite, JQuery, and Meekro D to create, maintain, and query the database.
